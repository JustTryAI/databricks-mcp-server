## Phase 2: API Module Reorganization

### Implemented Changes

#### Workflow APIs
- Created `src/api/workflow` directory with:
  - `__init__.py`: Re-exports all functions from jobs and pipelines modules
  - `jobs.py`: Functions for interacting with the Databricks Jobs API
  - `pipelines.py`: Functions for interacting with the Databricks Pipelines API
- Updated original modules to be deprecated:
  - `src/api/jobs.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `workflow/jobs.py`
  - `src/api/pipelines.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `workflow/pipelines.py`

#### Compute APIs
- Created `src/api/compute` directory with:
  - `__init__.py`: Re-exports all functions from clusters and libraries modules
  - `clusters.py`: Functions for interacting with the Databricks Clusters API
  - `libraries.py`: Functions for interacting with the Databricks Libraries API
- Updated original modules to be deprecated:
  - `src/api/clusters.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `compute/clusters.py`
  - `src/api/libraries.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `compute/libraries.py`

#### Next Steps
- Create additional API subdirectories as needed (storage, access, etc.)
- Update public documentation
