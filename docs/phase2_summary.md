# API Refactoring Phase 2 Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 of the API refactoring plan focuses on reorganizing API modules into logical subdirectories to better align with Databricks API documentation structure. This phase involved creating dedicated subdirectories for compute and workflow-related APIs.

## Completed Work

### Workflow API Group
1. Created the `src/api/workflow` directory with:
   - `__init__.py`: Re-exports all workflow API functions
   - `jobs.py`: Functions for managing Databricks jobs
   - `pipelines.py`: Functions for managing Delta Live Tables pipelines

2. Updated original modules to be deprecated:
   - `src/api/jobs.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `workflow/jobs.py`
   - `src/api/pipelines.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `workflow/pipelines.py`

### Compute API Group
1. Created the `src/api/compute` directory with:
   - `__init__.py`: Re-exports all compute API functions
   - `clusters.py`: Functions for managing Databricks clusters
   - `libraries.py`: Functions for managing libraries on clusters

2. Updated original modules to be deprecated:
   - `src/api/clusters.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `compute/clusters.py`
   - `src/api/libraries.py`: Marked as deprecated, imports from `compute/libraries.py`

### Documentation
1. Updated `docs/api_refactoring.md` to reflect the changes made in Phase 2
2. Created this summary document

## Benefits of the Reorganization

1. **Improved Organization**: Related API functions are now grouped together in logical subdirectories
2. **Better Alignment**: Structure now better aligns with the official Databricks API documentation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility through deprecated modules
4. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Functions are now easier to discover based on their category
5. **Cleaner Imports**: Users can now import from specific API groups rather than individual modules

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Further API Organization**:
   - Identify and create additional API subdirectories as needed (storage, access, etc.)
   - Move remaining modules to appropriate subdirectories

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update all docstrings to be consistent across modules
   - Update public documentation to reflect the new structure
   - Create examples showing how to use the new import paths

3. **Testing**:
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all reorganized modules
   - Verify that both deprecated and new import paths work as expected

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Remove commented-out compatibility code once the transition is complete
   - Plan for eventual removal of deprecated modules in a future release

## Transition Period

During the transition period:
1. Both old and new import paths will work
2. Deprecated modules will show warnings encouraging users to update their imports
3. All existing code will continue to function as before, ensuring a smooth transition
