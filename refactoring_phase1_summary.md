# Databricks MCP Server Refactoring - Phase 1 Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. API Organization Alignment - Phase 1: Workspace and Notebooks Consolidation

- **Unified Workspace API Module**:
  - Consolidated all functions from `notebooks.py` into `workspace.py`
  - Renamed functions to follow a consistent pattern (`list_workspace`, `export_workspace`, etc.)
  - Added backward compatibility aliases for old function names
  - Improved documentation to reflect the unified API
  - Enhanced the content handling with proper base64 encoding/decoding

- **Deprecated Original Notebooks API**:
  - Added clear deprecation warnings in `notebooks.py` module
  - Modified all functions to delegate to their workspace counterparts 
  - Added documentation about the deprecation and migration path

- **Updated Tools Implementation**:
  - Modified `workspace_tools.py` to use the new unified API functions
  - Added deprecation warnings to `notebooks_tools.py`
  - Made `notebooks_tools.py` delegate to the workspace API functions
  - Updated the server registration to mark notebooks tools as deprecated

- **Prepared for Future Structure**:
  - Added new subdirectories for future organization:
    - `src/api/compute/` - Will contain clusters, instance_pools, libraries
    - `src/api/workflow/` - Will contain jobs, pipelines
  - Added `__init__.py` files with imports for backward compatibility
  - Updated main `src/api/__init__.py` with documentation about the reorganization

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: API Module Reorganization

1. **Move Clusters, Libraries to compute/ subdirectory**:
   - Create new module files in `src/api/compute/`
   - Move functionality while preserving imports
   - Update parent modules to import from new locations

2. **Move Jobs, Pipelines to workflow/ subdirectory**:
   - Create new module files in `src/api/workflow/`
   - Move functionality while preserving imports
   - Update parent modules to import from new locations

3. **Create Additional API Subdirectories**:
   - `src/api/storage/` - For DBFS, volumes, external_locations
   - `src/api/security/` - For tokens, secrets, service_principals
   - `src/api/sql/` - For SQL-related modules

### Phase 3: Tool Standardization

1. **Standardize Tool Names**:
   - Normalize function naming conventions (singular form)
   - Update registration functions (e.g., `register_jobs_tools` â†’ `register_job_tools`)

2. **Reorganize Tool Module Structure**:
   - Create subdirectories matching API structure
   - Update imports and registrations

## Testing and Validation

- All existing functionality should continue to work through this transition
- Deprecated modules should show appropriate warnings but continue to function
- New imports from reorganized modules should work correctly

## Timeline

- Phase 2 is expected to be completed within [timeframe]
- Full refactoring completion expected by [target date]

## Notes

- The refactoring has been designed to maintain backward compatibility
- All deprecation warnings include clear migration paths
- New code should use the new API structure directly
